CFD Research Corporation was awarded the FDA funding opportunity titled “Physiologically Based Absorption and Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulation for Non-gastrointestinally Absorbed Drug Products in Humans (U01)”, Subtopic 2: “Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of ocular absorption” (FOA: RFA-FD-14-012). The goal of the awarded project is to develop a powerful multiscale-multiphysics computational tool that can simulate ocular delivery, dissolution, transport, absorption and pharmacokinetics (PK) of generic drugs and drug products. This 3-year cooperative agreement project with the FDA started September 1st 2014 and will end August 30th 2017.

The software tool was created using C++ and open source libraries, Qt and Openscenegraph, and the linked CFD solver, CoBi, is from CFD Research Coporation.
